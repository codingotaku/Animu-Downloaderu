# Animu-Downloaderu

## Notes

1. Now has three Servers (Anime1, AnimeFreak, and GogoAnime1) all are in essence the same site (same content hosted differently).
1. Uses AnimeCrawlerAPI ([github](https://github.com/codingotaku/AnimeCrawlerAPI), [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/codingotaku/AnimeCrawlerAPI)) for fetching Anime.
1. Modified code so that it would be easier to add new servers in the future! ([this file](./src/main/java/com/codingotaku/apps/source/AnimeSources.java))
We might add more servers in the future! 
1. Android version is not the top priority as of now.

 **I do not support piracy!**, The only reason for me making this app was because of the DRM (Digital Restrictions Management) and licensing that mainstream anime hosing services has and the ad+tracking malware other websites adopted to.
